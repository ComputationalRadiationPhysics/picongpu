PIConGPU is a program collection containing the main simulation, independent
scripts and auxiliary libraries. If not stated otherwise explicitly, the
following licenses apply:


### PIConGPU

The **main simulation** is licensed under the **GPLv3+**. See
[COPYING](COPYING). If not stated otherwise explicitly, that affects:
 - `buildsystem`
 - `etc/picongpu`
 - `include/picongpu`
 - `lib/python/picongpu`
 - `share/picongpu`
 - `src/tools` (without `splash2txt`)
 - `src/mpiInfo`
 - `test`


### PMacc & splash2txt
 
All **libraries** are licensed under the **LGPLv3+**. See
[COPYING.LESSER](COPYING.LESSER).
If not stated otherwise explicitly, that affects:
 - `include/pmacc`
 - `share/pmacc`
 - `src/tools/splash2txt`


### Documentation

Documentation is licensed under CC-BY 4.0.
See https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ for the license.

If not stated otherwise explicitly, that affects files in:

- `docs`


### Third party software and other licenses

We include a list of (GPL-) compatible third party software for the sake
of an easier install of `PIConGPU`. Contributions to these parts of the
repository should *not* be made in the `thirdParty/` directory but in
*their according repositories* (that we import).

 - `thirdParty/alpaka`:
   alpaka is a header-only C++11 abstraction library for parallel
   kernel development on accelerator hardware. It provides a single-source,
   performance portable programming model for PIConGPU and PMacc.
   Please visit
     https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/alpaka
   for further details and contributions.

 - `thirdParty/mallocMC`:
   mallocMC is a fast memory allocator for many core accelerators and was
   originally forked from the `ScatterAlloc` project.
   It is licensed under the *MIT License*.
   Please visit
     https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/mallocMC
   for further details and contributions.

 - `thirdParty/cmake-modules`:
   we published a set of useful CMake modules that are not in the
   CMake mainline under the *ISC license* at
     https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/cmake-modules
   for contributions or inclusion in PIConGPU and other projects.

 - `thirdParty/cuda_memtest`:
   CUDA MemTest is an *independent program* developed by the University
   Illinois, published under the *Illinois Open Source License*.
   Please refer to the file `thirdParty/cuda_memtest/README` for license information.
   We redistribute this modified version of CUDA MemTest under the same license
   [thirdParty/cuda_memtest/README](thirdParty/cuda_memtest/README).
   The original release was published at
     http://sourceforge.net/projects/cudagpumemtest
   and our modified version is hosted at
     https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/cuda_memtest
   for further reference.

- `thirdParty/cupla`:
   cupla is a simple user interface for alpaka. It provides a software layer
   that follows a similar concept as the Nvidia CUDA API, allowing to write
   kernels more efficiently.
   Please visit
     https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/cupla
   for further details and contributions.
