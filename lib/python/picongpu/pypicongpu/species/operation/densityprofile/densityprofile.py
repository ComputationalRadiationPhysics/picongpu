        retrieve a context valid for "any profile"

        Problem: Every profile has its respective schema, and it is difficult
        in JSON (particularly in a mustache-compatible way) the type of the
        schema.

        Solution: The normal rendering of profiles get_rendering_context()
        provides **only their parameters**, i.e. there is **no meta
        information** on types etc.

        If a generic profile is requested one can use the schema for
        "DensityProfile" (this class), for which this method returns the
        correct content, which includes metainformation and the data on the
        schema itself.

        E.g.:

        .. code::

            {
                "type": {
                    "uniform": true,
                    "gaussian": false,
                    ...
                },
                "data": DATA
            }

        where DATA is the serialization as returned by get_rendering_context().

        There are *two* context serialization methods for density profiles:

        - get_rendering_context()

            - provided by RenderedObject parent class, serialization ("context
              building") performed by _get_serialized()
            - _get_serialized() implemented in *every profile*
            - checks against schema of respective profile
            - returned context is a representation of *exactly this profile*
            - (left empty == not implemented in parent ProfileDensity)

        - get_generic_profile_rendering_context()

            - implemented in parent ProfileDensity
            - returned representation is generic for *any profile*
              (i.e. contains meta information which type is actually used)
            - passes information from get_rendering_context() through
            - returned representation is designed for easy use with templating
