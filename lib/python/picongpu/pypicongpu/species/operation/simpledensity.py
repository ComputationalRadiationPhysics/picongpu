        ppc and species are translated 1-by-1,
        species with lowest ratio is "placed initially", i.e. it is placed
        first.

        All other species are put into a separate list, which will have their
        macroparticle position copied from the first species.

        Rationale:
        PIConGPU works using this pattern, i.e. copying the macroparticle
        position from the first species.

        Also, there is a "minimum weighting" inside of PIConGPU, which prevents
        macroparticle creation if the weighting of a macroparticle is too low.
        (This has physics reasons.)

        However, this minimum weighting is ignored when copying particles.
        To ensure that the minimum weighting is kept the species with the
        **lowest density ratio** is placed first.

        I.e. **IF NO PARTICLES ARE PLACED** check **MINIMUM WEIGHTING**

        After the initial species has been placed all other species' (stored in
        a separate list without particluar order) macroparticle positions are
        copied from the first. Weightings are adjusted to the ratio between the
        first (copy source) and the respective (copy destination) species
        density ratios.

        Notably, this requires the initial placement to *adjust the first
        species' weighting according to its density weighting*.
        This is automatically performed by PIConGPU's `CreateDensity`.
