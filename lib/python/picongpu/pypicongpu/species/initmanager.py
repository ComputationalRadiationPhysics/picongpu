    Helper to manage species translation to PIConGPU

    Collects all species to be initialized and the operations initializing
    them.

    Invokes the methods of the Operation lifecycle (check, prebook, bake).

    Workflow:

    1. Fill InitManager (from outside) with

       - Species and their constants (no attributes!)
       - Operations, fully initialized (all params set)

    2. invoke InitManager.bake(), which

       - checks the Species for conflicts (name...)
       - performs dependency checks, possibly reorders species
       - invokes the Operation lifecycle (check, prebook, bake)
       - sanity-checks the results

    3. retrieve rendering context

       - organizes operations into lists

    Note: The InitManager manages a lifecycle, it does not perform deep checks
          -> most errors have to be caught by delegated checks.
