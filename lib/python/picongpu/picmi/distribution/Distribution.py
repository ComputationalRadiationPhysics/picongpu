note on rms_velocity:
---------------------
The rms_velocity is converted to a temperature in keV. This conversion requires the mass of the species to be known,
which is not the case inside the picmi density distribution.

As an abstraction, **every** PICMI density distribution implements `picongpu_get_rms_velocity_si()` which returns a
tuple (float, float, float) with the rms_velocity per axis in SI units (m/s).

In case the density profile does not have an rms_velocity, this method **MUST** return (0, 0, 0), which is translated to
"no temperature initialization" by the owning species.

note on drift:
--------------
The drift ("velocity") is represented using either directed_velocity or centroid_velocity (v, gamma*v respectively) and
for the pypicongpu representation stored in a separate object (Drift).

To accommodate that, this separate Drift object can be requested by the method get_picongpu_drift(). In case of no drift,
this method returns None.
