Change Log / Release Log for PIConGPU
================================================================

0.1.0
-----
**Date:** 2015-05-13

This is version `0.1.0` of PIConGPU, a *pre-beta* version.

Initial field ionization support was added, including the first model for BSI.
The code-base was substantially hardened, fixing several minor and major
issues. Especially, several restart related issues, an issue with 2D3V zigzack
current calculation and a memory issue with Jetson TK1 boards were fixed.
A work-around for a critical CUDA 6.5 compiler bug was applied to all affected
parts of the code.

Open Beta RC6
-------------
**Date:** 2014-11-25

This is the 6th release candidate, a *pre-beta* version.

Initial "multiple species" support was added for flexible particles,
but is yet still limited to two species.
The checkpoint system was refactored and unified, also incooperating
extreme high file I/O bandwidth with ADIOS 1.7+ support.
The JetsonTK1 development kit (32bit ARM host side) is now experimentally
supported by libPMacc/PIConGPU.
The *ZigZag* current deposition scheme was implemented providing
40% to 50% speedup over our optimized Esirkepov implementation.

Open Beta RC5
-------------
**Date:** 2014-06-04

This is the 5th release candidate, a *pre-beta* version.

We rebuild our complete plugin and restart scheme, most of these
changes are not backwards compatible and you will have to upgrade
to libSplash 1.2+ for HDF5 output (this just means: you can
not restart from a beta-rc4 checkpoint with this release).

HDF5 output with libSplash does not contain *ghost*/*guard* data
any more. These information are just necessary for checkpoints
(which are now separated from the regular output).
