Photons

Radiation reaction and (hard) photons: why and when are they needed.
Models we implemented and verified:

* :ref:`Landau-Lifschitz Model (semi-classical) <model-LL-RR>`
* QED Models (Synchrotron & Bremsstrahlung)

Would be great to add your Diploma Thesis talk with pictures and comments here.

Please add notes and warnings on the models' assumptions for an easy guiding on their usage :)

.. note::
   Assumptions in Furry-picture and Volkov-States: classical em wave part and QED "pertubation".
   EM fields on grid (Synchrotron) and density modulations (Bremsstrahlung) need to be locally constant compared to radiated coherence interval ("constant-crossed-field approximation").

.. attention::
   Bremsstrahlung: The individual electron direction and gamma emission are not correlated.
   (momentum is microscopically / per e- not conserved, only collectively.)

.. attention::
   "Soft" photons from low energy electrons will get underestimated in intensity below a threshold of ... .
   Their energy is still always conserved until cutoff (defined in ...).

.. note::
   An electron can only emit a photon with identical weighting.
   Otherwise, the statistical variation of their energy loss would be weighting dependent
   (note that the average energy loss is unaffected by that).
