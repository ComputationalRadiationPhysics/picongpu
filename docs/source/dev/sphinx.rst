Build Locally
-------------

This document is build based on free open-source software, namely `Sphinx`_, `Doxygen`_ (C++ APIs as XML) and `Breathe`_ (to include doxygen XML in Sphinx).
A web-version is hosted on `ReadTheDocs`_.

.. _Sphinx: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx
.. _Doxygen: http://doxygen.org
.. _Breathe: https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe
.. _ReadTheDocs: https://readthedocs.org/

The following requirements need to be installed (once) to build our documentation successfully:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd docs/

    # doxygen is not shipped via pip, install it externally,
    # from the homepage, your package manager, conda, etc.
    # example:
    sudo apt-get install doxygen

    # python tools & style theme
    pip install -r requirements.txt # --user


With all documentation-related software successfully installed, just run the following commands to build your docs locally.
Please check your documentation build is successful and renders as you expected before opening a pull request!

.. code-block:: bash

    # skip this if you are still in docs/
    cd docs/

    # parse the C++ API documentation,
    #   enjoy the doxygen warnings!
    doxygen
    # render the `.rst` files and replace their macros within
    #   enjoy the breathe errors on things it does not understand from doxygen :)
    make html

    # open it, e.g. with firefox :)
    firefox build/html/index.html

    # now again for the pdf :)
    make latexpdf

    # open it, e.g. with okular
    build/latex/PIConGPU.pdf
