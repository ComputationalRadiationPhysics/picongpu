Atomic rate equation solver
===========================

When solving the rate equation the following new complications arise,
 - each macro ion can only have one state
 - macro particles should be independent of each other for better paralelisation

in addition to the already existing compications all solvers face,
 - we need to acount for widely differing rates
 - more than one transition can occur for any given time step

This 


Instead of solving the rate equation directly we try to modell 
is a good principal description of the atomic state time
