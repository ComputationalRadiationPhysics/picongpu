Positions Particles
-------------------

This plugin prints out the *position, momentum, mass, macro particle weighting, electric charge and relativistic gamma factor* of a particle to ``stdout`` (usually inside the ``simOutput/output`` file).
**It only works with test simulations that have only one particle.**

.cfg file
^^^^^^^^^

By setting the command line flag ``--<species>_position.period`` to a non-zero number, the analyzer is used.
In order to get the particle trajectory for each time step the period needs to be set to ``1``, meaning e.g. ``--e_position.period 1`` for electrons.
If less output is needed, e.g. only every 10th time step, the period can be set to different values, e.g. ``--e_position.period 10``.

Output
^^^^^^

The electron trajectory is written directly to the *standard output*.
Therefore, it goes both to ``simOutput/output`` as well as to the output file specified by the machine used (usually the ``stdout`` file in the main directory of the simulation).
The output is ASCII-text only.
It has the following format:

.. code::

   [ANALYSIS] [MPI_Rank] [COUNTER] [<species>_position] [currentTimeStep] currentTime {position.x position.y position.z} {momentum.x momentum.y momentum.z} mass weighting charge gamma

.. code::

   # an example output line:
   [ANALYSIS] [2] [COUNTER] [e_position] [878] 1.46440742e-14 {1.032e-05 4.570851689815522e-05 5.2e-06} {0 -1.

In order to extract only the trajectory information from the total output stored in ``stdout``, the following command on a bash command line could be used:

.. code:: bash

   grep "e_position" stdout > trajectory.dat

The particle data is then stored in ``trajectory.dat``.

In order to extract e.g. the position from this line the following can be used:

.. code:: bash

   cat trajectory.dat | awk '{print $7}' | sed -e "s/{//g" | sed -e 's/}//g' | sed -e 's/,/\t/g' > position.dat

Known Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- this plugin is only available with the CUDA backend

Known Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. attention::

   This plugin only works correctly if a single particle is simulated.
   If more than one particle is simulated, the output becomes random, because only the information of one particle is printed.
   This plugin might be upgraded to work with multiple particles, but better use our openPMD plugin instead and assign ``particleId``\ s to individual particles.

.. attention::

   Currently, both ``simOutput/output`` and ``stdout`` are overwritten at restart.
   All data from the plugin is lost, if these file are not backuped manually.
