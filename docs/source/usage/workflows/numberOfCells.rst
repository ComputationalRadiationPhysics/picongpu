Setting the Number of Cells
---------------------------

.. sectionauthor:: Axel Huebl

Together with the grid resolution in :ref:`grid.param <usage-params-core>`, the number of cells in our :ref:`.cfg files <usage-tbg>` determine the overall size of a simulation (box).
The following rules need to be applied when setting the number of cells:

Each GPU needs to:

#. contain an integer *multiple* of supercells
#. at least *three* supercells

Supercell sizes in terms of number of cells are set in :ref:`memory.param <usage-params-memory>` and are by default ``8x8x4`` for 3D3V simulations on GPUs.
For 2D3V simulations, ``16x16`` is usually a good supercell size, however the default is simply cropped to ``8x8``, so make sure to change it to get more performance.
