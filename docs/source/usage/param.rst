.param Files
============

.. sectionauthor:: Axel Huebl

Parameter files, ``*.param`` placed in ``include/picongpu/simulation_defines/param/`` are used to set all **compile-time options** for a PIConGPU simulation.
This includes most fundamental options such as numerical solvers, floating precision, memory usage due to attributes and super-cell based algorithms, density profiles, initial conditions etc.

Editing
-------

For convenience, we provide a tool ``pic-edit`` to edit the compile-time input by its name.
For example, if you want to edit the *grid* and time step resolution, *file output* and add a *laser* to the simulation, open the according files via:

.. code-block:: bash
   :emphasize-lines: 4

   # first switch to your input directory
   cd $HOME/picInputs/myLWFA

   pic-edit grid fileOutput laser

See ``pic-edit --help`` for all available files:

.. program-output:: ../../pic-edit --help

Rationale
---------

High-performance hardware comes with a lot of restrictions on how to use it, mainly memory, control flow and register limits.
In order to create an efficient simulation, PIConGPU compiles to **exactly** the numerical solvers (kernels) and physical attributes (fields, species) for the setup you need to run, which will furthermore be specialized for a specific hardware.

This comes at a small cost: when **even one of those settings is changed, you need to recompile**.
Nevertheless, wasting about 5 minutes compiling on a single node is nothing compared to the time you save *at scale*!

All options that are less or non-critical for runtime performance, such as specific ranges observables in :ref:`plugins <usage-plugins>` or how many nodes shall be used, can be set in :ref:`run time configuration files (*.cfg) <usage-tbg>` and do not need a recompile when changed.

Files and Their Usage
---------------------

If you use our ``pic-configure`` :ref:`script wrappers <usage-basics>`, you do not need to set *all* available parameter files since we will add the missing ones with *sane defaults*.
Those defaults are:

* a standard, single-precision, well normalized PIC cycle suitable for relativistic plasmas
* no external forces (no laser, no initial density profile, no background fields, etc.)

All Files
---------

When setting up a simulation, it is recommended to adjust ``.param`` files in the following order:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   param/core
   param/memory
   param/extensions
   param/plugins
   param/misc
