*A particle-in-cell code for GPGPUs*

PIConGPU is a fully relativistic, many GPGPU, 3D3V particle-in-cell (PIC) code.
The Particle-in-Cell algorithm is a central tool in plasma physics.
It describes the dynamics of a plasma by computing the motion of electrons and ions in the plasma based on Maxwell's equations.

How to Read This Document
-------------------------

Generally, you want to follow those pages in-order to get started.
Individual chapters are based on the information of the chapters before.

In case you are already fluent in compiling C++ projects and HPC, running PIC simulations or scientific data analysis feel free to jump the respective sections.

.. attention::
   This documentation is just getting started.
