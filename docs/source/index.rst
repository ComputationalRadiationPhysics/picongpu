A particle-in-cell code for GPGPUs

Introduction
============

PIConGPU is a fully relativistic, many GPGPU, 3D3V particle-in-cell (PIC) code.
The Particle-in-Cell algorithm is a central tool in plasma physics.
It describes the dynamics of a plasma by computing the motion of electrons and ions in the plasma based on Maxwell's equations.
