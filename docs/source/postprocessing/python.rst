Python
======

.. sectionauthor:: Axel Huebl

If you are new to python, get your hands on the tutorials of the following important libraries to get started.

- https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/
- https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html


Numpy
-----

Numpy is the universal swiss army knife for working on ND arrays in python.

Matplotlib
----------

One common way to visualize plots:

Jupyter
-------

Access, share, modify, run and interact with your python scripts from your browser:

https://jupyter.readthedocs.io


openPMD-viewer
--------------

A library that reads and visualizes data in our HDF5 files thanks to their :ref:`openPMD markup <pp-openPMD>`.
Provides an API to correctly convert units to SI, interpret iteration steps correctly, annotate axis and much more.
Also provides an interactive GUI for fast exploration via Jupyter notebooks.

yt-project
----------

With yt 3.4 or newer, our HDF5 output, which uses the :ref:`openPMD markup <pp-openPMD>`, can be read, processed and visualized with yt.

pyDive (experimental)
---------------------

pyDive provides numpy-style array and file processing on distributed memory systems ("numpy on MPI" for data sets that are much larger than your local RAM).
pyDive is currently not ready to interpret :ref:`openPMD <pp-openPMD>` directly, but can work on generated raw ADIOS and HDF5 files.
