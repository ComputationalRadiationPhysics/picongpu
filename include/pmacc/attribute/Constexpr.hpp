/**
 * Visual Studio has a bug with constexpr variables being captured in lambdas as
 * non-constexpr variables, causing build errors. The issue has been verified
 * for versions 14.0 and 15.5 (latest at the moment) and is also reported in
 * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28763375/using-lambda-captured-constexpr-value-as-an-array-dimension
 * and related issue
 * https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/1997/constexpr-not-implicitely-captured-in-lambdas.html
 *
 * As a workaround (until this is fixed in VS) add a new PMACC_CONSTEXPR_CAPTURE
 * macro for declaring constexpr variables that are captured in lambdas and have
 * to remain constexpr inside a lambda e.g., used as a template argument. Such
 * variables have to be declared with PMACC_CONSTEXPR_CAPTURE instead of
 * constexpr. The macro will be replaced with just constexpr for other compilers
 * and for Visual Studio with static constexpr, which makes it capture properly.
 *
 * Note that this macro is to be used only in very few cases, where not only a
 * constexpr is captured, but also it has to remain constexpr inside a lambda.
