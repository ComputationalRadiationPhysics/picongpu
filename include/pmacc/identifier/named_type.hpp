/** define a unique identifier with name, type and a default value
 * @param in_type type of the value
 * @param name name of identifier
 *
 * The created identifier has the following options:
 *          getName()         - return the name of the identifier
 *          ::type            - get contained type
 *
 * e.g. named_type(float,length)
 *      typedef length::type value_type; // is float
 *      printf("Identifier name: %s",length::getName()); //print Identifier name: length
 *
 * to create a instance of this value_identifier you can use:
 *      length();   or length_
