             *  Example: X Side
             *      The beam propagates along the x axis ( PIC coordinate system).
             *      The base position of the beam coordinate system (0,0,0) point it
             *      the beam system is placed at in the middle of the x_PIC=0 plane.
             *      That is at (0, 0.5 * Y, 0.5 * Z), where Y and Z are the lengths of
             *      the simulation box sides along y_PIC and z_PIC axes.
             *      Therefore beamStartPosition= ( 0.0, 0.5, 0.5 ) for the XSide.
             *
             *      AxisMap defines how the 3 directions
             *      (x, y, z) in the PIC system correspond to the ones in the beam
             *      system. The true/false in reverse define the relative orientations. For XSide:
             *      axisMap = { 2, 1, 0}; reverse = {true, false, false > says:
             *          * x_beam = - z_PIC,
             *          * y_beam = y_PIC,
             *          * z_beam = x_PIC,
