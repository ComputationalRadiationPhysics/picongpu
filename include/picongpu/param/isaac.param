/** @file
 *
 * Definition which native fields and density fields of particles will be
 * visualizable with ISAAC. ISAAC is an in-situ visualization library with which
 * the PIC simulation can be observed while it is running avoiding the time
 * consuming writing and reading of simulation data for the classical post
 * processing of data.
 *
 * ISAAC can directly visualize natives fields like the E or B field, but
 * density fields of particles need to be calculated from PIConGPU on the fly
 * which slightly increases the runtime and the memory consumption. Every
 * particle density field will reduce the amount of memory left for PIConGPUs
 * particles and fields.
 *
 * To get best performance, ISAAC defines an exponential amount of different
 * visualization kernels for every combination of (at runtime) activated
 * fields. So furthermore a lot of fields will increase the compilation time.
