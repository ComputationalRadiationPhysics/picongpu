/** @file
 *
 * This background field implements a obliquely incident, cylindrically-focused, pulse-front tilted laser for some
 * incidence angle phi as used for [1].
 *
 * The TWTS implementation generally follows the definition of eq. (7) in [1]. In deriving the magnetic field
 * components, a slowly-varying wave approximation was assumed, by neglegting the spatial derivatives of the
 * 2nd omega-order TWTS-phase-terms for the B-field-component transverse to direction of propagation, and additionally
 * neglect the 1st-order TWTS-phase-terms for the B-field-component longitudinal to the direction of propagation.
 *
 * Specifically, this TWTSfast approximation assumes a special case, where the transverse extent (but not its height wx
 * or its pulse duration) of the TWTS-laser wy is assumed to be infinite. While this special case of the TWTS laser
 * applies to a large range of use cases, the resulting form allows to use different spatial and time coordinates
 * (timeMod, yMod and zMod), which allow long term numerical stability beyond 100000 timesteps at single precision,
 * as well as for mitigating errors of the approximations far from the coordinate origin.
 *
 * We exploit the wavelength-periodicity and the known propagation direction for realizing the laser pulse
 * using relative coordinates (i.e. from a finite coordinate range) only. All these quantities have to be calculated
 * in double precision.
 *
 * float_64 const tanAlpha = (float_64(1.0) - beta_0 * math::cos(phi)) / (beta_0 * math::sin(phi));
 * float_64 const tanFocalLine = math::tan(PI / float_64(2.0) - phi);
 * float_64 const deltaT = wavelength_SI / sim.si.getSpeedOfLight() * (float_64(1.0) + tanAlpha / tanFocalLine);
 * float_64 const deltaY = wavelength_SI / tanFocalLine;
 * float_64 const deltaZ = -wavelength_SI;
 * float_64 const numberOfPeriods = math::floor(time / deltaT);
 * float_T const timeMod = float_T(time - numberOfPeriods * deltaT);
 * float_T const yMod = float_T(pos.y() + numberOfPeriods * deltaY);
 * float_T const zMod = float_T(pos.z() + numberOfPeriods * deltaZ);
