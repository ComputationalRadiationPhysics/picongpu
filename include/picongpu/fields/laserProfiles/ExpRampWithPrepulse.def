             * Allows defining a prepulse and two regions of exponential preramp with
             * independent slopes. The definition works by specifying three (t, intensity)-
             * points, where time is counted from the very beginning in SI and the
             * intensity (yes, intensity, not amplitude) is given in multiples of the main
             * peak.
             *
             * Be careful - problematic for few cycle pulses. Thought the rest is cloned
             * from laserWavepacket, the correctionFactor is not included (this made a
             * correction to the laser phase, which is necessary for very short pulses,
             * since otherwise a test particle is, after the laser pulse has passed, not
             * returned to immobility, as it should). Since the analytical solution is
             * only implemented for the Gaussian regime, and we have mostly exponential
             * regimes here, it was not retained here.
             *
             * A Gaussian peak (optionally lengthened by a plateau) is preceded by
             * two pieces of exponential preramps, defined by 3 (time, intensity)-
             * -points.
             *
             * The first two points get connected by an exponential, the 2nd and
             * 3rd point are connected by another exponential, which is then
             * extrapolated to the peak. The Gaussian is added everywhere, but
             * typically contributes significantly only near the peak.
             * It is advisable to set the third point far enough from the plateau
             * (approx 3*FWHM), then the contribution from the Gaussian is
             * negligible there, and the intensity can be set as measured from the
             * laser profile.
             *
             * Optionally a Gaussian prepulse can be added, given by the parameters
             * of the relative intensity and time point.
             * The time of the prepulse and the three preramp points are given in
             * SI, the intensities are given as multiples of the peak intensity.
