        * The relay point calculation differs from the ZigZag paper version in the point
        * that the trajectory of a particle which does not leave the cell is not split.
        * The relay point for a particle which does not leave the cell is set to the
        * current position `x_2`
        *
        * If `i_1 == i_2` than the trajectory is not split.
        *
        * This function assumes that the shape in later steps is always evaluated
        * at grid integral points.
