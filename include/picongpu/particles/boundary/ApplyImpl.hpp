             *
             * This functor operates on the near-boundary area where the boundary conditions are active.
             * Currently, this is always a part of the GUARD area of the currently outer domains (wrt periodicity).
             * The functor would only be called for the relevant exchang types of such domains.
             * If there are particles left in this area after this functor ran, they will be removed later.
             *
             * So for standard Absorbing boundaries in GUARD the functor does not need to do anything.
             * For Periodic boundaries, there are no outer domains and so again no need to do anything here.
             *
             * Thus, the general implementation doing nothing is already suited for Absorbing and Periodic.
             * However, it probably needs to be specialized for other boundary types or other Absorbing zones.
             * In this case, the implementation must ensure particles are moved to correct supercells afterwards.
             * In the general case, by calling shiftParticles() at the end.
