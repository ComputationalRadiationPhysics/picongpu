        /** Apply a manipulation for each particle of a species or a sequence of species
         *
         * This function provides a high-level interface to particle manipulation
         * from simulation stages and plugins, but not .param files. The common
         * workflow is as follows:
         * - select the species to manipulate, often by filtering VectorAllSpecies
         * - define a manipulator type; in case the manipulator has a species type
         * as a template parameter, use the boost::mpl::_1 placeholder instead
         * - define a filter type when necessary
         * - call manipulate()
         *
         * This is a function-style wrapper around creating a Manipulate object and
         * calling its operator(). Unlike Manipulate, it supports both single
         * species and sequences of species.
         *
         * Has a version for a fixed area, and for a user-provided mapper factory.
         * They differ only in how the area is defined.
         *
