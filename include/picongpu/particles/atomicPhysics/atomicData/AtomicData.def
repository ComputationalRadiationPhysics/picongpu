     * The atomicPhysics step relies on a model of atomic states and transitions for each
     * atomicPhysics ion species.
     * These model's parameters are provided by the user in .txt files of specified format
     * (see atomicPhysics model documentation) at runtime.
     *
     *  PIConGPU itself only includes charge state data, for ADK-, Thomas-Fermi- and BSI-ionization.
     *  All other atomic state data is kept separate from PIConGPU itself, due to licensing requirements.
     *
     * These files are read at the start of the simulation and stored distributed over the following:
     *  - charge state property data [ChargeStateData.hpp]
     *      * ionization energy
     *      * screened charge
     *  - charge state orga data [ChargeStateOrgaData.hpp]
     *      * number of atomic states for each charge state
     *      * start index block for charge state in list of atomic states
     * - atomic state property data [AtomicStateData.hpp]
     *      * configNumber
     *      * state energy, above ground state of charge state
     * - atomic state orga data
     *      [AtomicStateNumberOfTransitionsData_Down.hpp, AtomicStateNumberOfTransitionsData_UpDown.hpp]
     *       * number of transitions (up-/)down for each atomic state,
     *          by type of transition(bound-bound/bound-free/autonomous)
     *      [AtomicStateStartIndexBlockData_Down.hpp, AtomicStateStartIndexBlockData_UpDown.hpp]
     *       * start index of atomic state's block of transitions in transition collection,
     *          by type of transition(bound-bound/bound-free/autonomous)
     * - pressure ionization data [IPDIonizationData.hpp]
     *      * pressure ionization state collectionIndex
     * - transition property data[BoundBoundTransitionData.hpp, BoundFreeTransitionData.hpp,
     *      AutonomousTransitionData.hpp]
     *      * parameters for cross section calculation for each modelled transition
     *
     * @note orga data describes the structure of the property data for faster lookups, lookups are always possible
     *       without it, but are possibly non performant
     *
     * For each of data subsets exists a dataBox class, a container class holding pmacc::dataBox'es, and a dataBuffer
     *  class, a container class holding pmacc::buffers in turn allowing access to the pmacc::dataBox'es.
     *
     * Each dataBuffer will create on demand a host- or device-side dataBox objects which in turn gives access to the
     *  data.
     *
     * Assumptions about input data are described in CheckTransitionTuple.hpp, ordering requirements of transitions in
     *  CompareTransitionTuple.hpp and all other requirements in the checkChargeStateList(), checkAtomicStateList() and
     *  checkTransitionsForEnergyInversion() methods.
