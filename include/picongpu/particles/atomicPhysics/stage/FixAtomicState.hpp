/** @file fixAtomicState sub-stage of atomicPhysics
 *
 * searches for inconsistencies between atomic state and charge state of macro-ions and fixes them by setting the
 *  atomic state to the ground state of the charge state if mismatched.
 *
 * The charge state of macro-ions is specified both directly by the boundElectrons and indirectly by the
 *  atomicStateCollectionIndex attributes, therefore requiring them to always be update together.
 * Unfortunately this requires access to the atomicState DataBase unavailable in code disregarding atomic states.
 *
 * Therefore it is possible that the boundElectrons attribute is updated without updating the
 * atomicStateCollectionIndex attribute outside the atomic physics step.
 *
 * To prevent this inconsistency from propagating, we check all macro ions with atomic physics for such inconsistencies
 * at the start of every atomicPhysics step and set the atomic state to ground state of the indicated charge state
 * if they do not match.
