             * The number of macroparticles in cell will be equal to ::numParticlesPerCell, unless
             * the weights will get below MIN_WEIGHTING.
             * Unlike for other sampling functors, the total weighting of macroparticles in a cell will not be exactly
             * equal to expected number of real particles in the cell.
             *
             * Instead, the functor will mimic the process of random sampling in the whole domain as follows.
             * First, consider a simplified case of uniform density on whole domain and all weightings equal to 1.
             * Denote m total number of cells and n = T_ParamClass::numParticlesPerCell.
             * Then the expected number of macroparticles in a cell is distributed as N ~ Binomial(m * n, 1 / m).
             * So to mimic random sampling we could have changed the number of macroparticles in a cell
             * from hard-set n to a binomially distributed random value N with expected value n.
             *
             * However, we would like to keep computational workload uniform between cells when possible.
             * (For low n also potentially do some importance sampling, that we also do generally for low density.)
             * So instead we keep N = n and adjust weightings to result in about the same sampled density in a cell as
             * the simplistic scheme described above.
             *
             * Denote w a weighting calculated for usual PIConGPU sampling in other functors.
             * The weighting in this method is sampled as W = w * n / N with N ~ Binomial(m * n, 1 / m).
             * That binomial distribution has parameters E(N) = n, Var(N) = n * (1 - 1/m).
             * For n > 5 and m >> 1 the we can approximate that distribution with Normal(n, n).
             * So with this approximation N = n + Z * sqrt(n) with Z ~ Normal(0, 1).
             * Thus, we sample weighting as follows: W = w * n / (n + Z * sqrt(n)) = W / (1 + Z / sqrt(n)).
