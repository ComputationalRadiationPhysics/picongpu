             *
             * This ionization model describes the atom inside the Thomas-Fermi framework
             * in a self-consistent way. There the electrons are modeled as a density
             * with respect to the distance from the core while the atomic core is often
             * assumed as a point charge. The atomic potential is considered to be finite
             * as a result of matter density and it defines the so-called "ion sphere".
             * Due to the overlap of adjacent ion spheres the ionization barrier can be
             * lowered and electrons become quasi-free in the system (resonance states).
             * The Thomas-Fermi model calculates an average ionization degree only with
             * respect to charge density and temperature. Through further assumptions
             * and fitting parameters the model gets extended to arbitrary temperatures
             * and atoms.
             *
