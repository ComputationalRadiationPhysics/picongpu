             *   by certain values of the Keldysh parameter
             * - takes the ionization energies of the various charge states of ions
             * - calculates the ionization rates and then the ionization probabilities from them
             * - ATTENTION: this approach is not very applicable for rapidly changing high intensity laser fields
             * - this is a Monte Carlo method: if a random number is smaller
             *   or equal than the ionization probability -> increase the charge state
             * - see for example: D. Bauer and P. Mulser. Exact field ionization rates in the barrier-suppression
             *   regime from numerical time-dependent Schroedinger-equation calculations.
             *   Physical Review A, 59(1):569+, January 1999.
