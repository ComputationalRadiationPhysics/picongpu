     *
     * - Keldysh viewed ionization not as multiple different effects but rather as
     *   one that can be classified in different ionization regimes characterized
     *   by certain values of the Keldysh parameter
     * - takes the ionization energies of the various charge states of ions
     * - calculates the ionization rates and then the ionization probabilities from them
     * - ATTENTION: this approach is not very applicable for rapidly changing high intensity laser fields
     * - this is a Monte Carlo method: if a random number is smaller
     *   or equal than the ionization probability -> increase the charge state
     * - see for example: D. Bauer and P. Mulser. Exact field ionization rates in the barrier-suppression
     *   regime from numerical time-dependent Schroedinger-equation calculations.
     *   Physical Review A, 59(1):569+, January 1999.
     *
     * wrapper class,
     * needed because the SrcSpecies cannot be known during the
     * first specialization of the ionization model in the particle definition
     * \see speciesDefinition.param
