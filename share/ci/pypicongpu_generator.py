"""@file Generate different CI test jobs for different Python version and
         depending on a requirement.txt.

Prints yaml code for a GitLab CI child pipeline to stdout. The test parameters
are split in two kinds of inputs. The Python versions to test are defined in
the script, also the names of dependencies to test and it's test strategy. The
version range of the dependencies to test are defined in the passed
requirements.txt files. The paths of the requirements.txt are set via the
application arguments.

First, the script reads the requirements.txt files. If a dependency is marked
as to be tested in the script, it calculates the test versions.
For this it downloads all available versions from pypi.org for each package.
Afterwards it filters the versions via a filter strategy. For example, take
all release versions or take each latest major version. Than the script
removes all versions, which are not supported, as defined in the combined
requirements.txt.
The result a complete list of all Python- and dependency- versions to test.

In the second part, the script creates the full combination matrix for all test
versions and creates a CI job for each combination. Each job is printed to
stdout.

The number of combinations depends on:
- number of supported Python version
- number of dependencies to test
- the test strategy of each dependencies to test
- versions restrictions in the requirements.txt
- releases of the dependencies
