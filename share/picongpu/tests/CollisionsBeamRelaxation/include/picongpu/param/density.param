/** @file
 *
 * Configure existing or define new normalized density profiles here.
 * During particle species creation in `speciesInitialization.param`,
 * those profiles can be translated to spatial particle distributions.
 *
 * This profile is normalized to units of `picongpu::SI::BASE_DENSITY_SI`, also defined in this file.
 * Note that it only operates with physical density, and does not concern macroparticles.
 * The number and sampling of macroparticles per cell are defined independently of a density profile.
 * Please refer to documentation of `picongpu::particles::CreateDensity<>` for further details on this interaction.
 *
 * Available profiles:
 *  - HomogenousImpl          : homogeneous density in whole simulation volume
 *  - GaussianImpl<>          : Gaussian profile in 'y', optionally with preceeding vacuum
 *  - GaussianCloudImpl<>     : Gaussian profile in all axes, optionally with preceeding vacuum in 'y'
 *  - LinearExponentialImpl<> : linear ramping of density in 'y' into exponential slope after
 *  - SphereFlanksImpl<>      : composition of 1D profiles, each in form of
 *                              exponential increasing flank, constant sphere, exponential decreasing flank
 *  - EveryNthCellImpl<>      : checkerboard profile matching the grid, particles are only present in cells
 *                              with the given stride from one another in all directions
 *  - FreeFormulaImpl<>       : apply user-defined functor for calculating density,
 *                              refer to `picongpu::densityProfiles::IProfile` for interface requirements
 *  - FromOpenPMDImpl<>       : load density values from a given file, requires openPMD API dependency
 *
 * In the end, this file typically defines an alias for each density profile to be used.
 * These aliases do not have to follow any naming convention, but serve as template parameters for
 * invocations of `picongpu::particles::CreateDensity<>` in `speciesInitialization.param`.
