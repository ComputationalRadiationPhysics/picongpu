 * Define particle species.
 *
 * This file collects all previous declarations of base (reference) quantities
 * and configured solvers for species and defines particle species. This
 * includes "attributes" (lvalues to store with each species) and "flags"
 * (rvalues & aliases for solvers to perform with the species for each timestep
 * and ratios to base quantities). With those information, a `Particles` class
 * is defined for each species and then collected in the list
 * `VectorAllSpecies`.
