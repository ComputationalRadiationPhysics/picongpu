/** @file
 *
 * A common task in both modeling and in situ processing (output) is the
 * selection of particles of a particle species by attributes. Users can
 * define such selections as particle filters in this file.
 *
 * Particle filters are simple mappings assigning each particle of a species
 * either `true` or `false` (ignore / filter out).
 *
 * All active filters need to be listed in `AllParticleFilters`. They are then
 * combined with `VectorAllSpecies` at compile-time, e.g. for plugins.
