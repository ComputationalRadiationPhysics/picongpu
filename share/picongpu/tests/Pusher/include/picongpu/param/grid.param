/** @file
 *
 * Definition of cell sizes and time step. Our cells are defining a regular,
 * cartesian grid. Our explicit FDTD field solvers require an upper bound for
 * the time step value in relation to the cell size for convergence. Make
 * sure to resolve important wavelengths of your simulation, e.g. shortest
 * plasma wavelength, Debye length and central laser wavelength both spatially
 * and temporarily.
 *
 * **Units in reduced dimensions**
 *
 * In 2D3V simulations, the CELL_DEPTH_SI (Z) cell length
 * is still used for normalization of densities, etc..
 *
 * A 2D3V simulation in a cartesian PIC simulation such as
 * ours only changes the degrees of freedom in motion for
 * (macro) particles and all (field) information in z
 * travels instantaneously, making the 2D3V simulation
 * behave like the interaction of infinite "wire particles"
 * in fields with perfect symmetry in Z.
