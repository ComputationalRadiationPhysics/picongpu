    /** FieldTmp output (calculated at runtime) *******************************
     *
     * Those operations derive scalar field quantities from particle species
     * at runtime. Each value is mapped per cell. Some operations are identical
     * up to a constant, so avoid writing those twice to save storage.
     *
     * you can choose any of these particle to grid projections:
     *   - Density: particle position + shape on the grid
     *   - BoundElectronDensity: density of bound electrons
     *       note: only makes sense for partially ionized ions
     *   - ChargeDensity: density * charge
     *       note: for species that do not change their charge state, this is
     *             the same as the density times a constant for the charge
     *   - Energy: sum of kinetic particle energy per cell with respect to shape
     *   - EnergyDensity: average kinetic particle energy per cell times the
     *                    particle density
     *       note: this is the same as the sum of kinetic particle energy
     *             divided by a constant for the cell volume
     *   - LarmorPower: radiated Larmor power
     *                  (species must contain the attribute `momentumPrev1`)
     *
     * for debugging:
     *   - MidCurrentDensityComponent:
     *       density * charge * velocity_component
     *   - Counter: counts point like particles per cell
     *   - MacroCounter: counts point like macro particles per cell
     *
     * combined attributes:
     *   These attributes are defined as a function of two primary derived attributes.
     *
     *   - AverageAttribute: template to compute a per particle average of any derived value
     *   - RelativisticDensity: equals to 1/gamma^2 * n. Where gamma is the Lorentz factor for the mean kinetic energy
     *      in the cell and n ist the usual number density. Useful for Faraday Rotation calculation.
     *
     *      Example use:
     *      @code{.cpp}
     *      using AverageEnergy_Seq = deriveField::CreateEligible_t<
     *          VectorAllSpecies,
     *          deriveField::combinedAttributes::AverageAttribute<deriveField::derivedAttributes::Energy>>;
     *      using RelativisticDensity_Seq
     *          = deriveField::CreateEligible_t<PIC_Electrons, deriveField::combinedAttributes::RelativisticDensity>;
     *      @endcode
     *
     * Filtering:
     *   You can create derived fields from filtered particles. Only particles passing
     *   the filter will contribute to the field quantity.
     *   For that you need to define your filters in `particleFilters.param` and pass a
     *   filter as the 3rd (optional) template argument in `CreateEligible_t`.
     *
     *   Example: This will create charge density field for all species that are
     *   eligible for the this attribute and the chosen filter.
     *   @code{.cpp}
     *   using ChargeDensity_Seq
         = deriveField::CreateEligible_t< VectorAllSpecies,
         deriveField::derivedAttributes::ChargeDensity, filter::FilterOfYourChoice>;
     *   @endcode
