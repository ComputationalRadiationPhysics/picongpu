Empty: Default PIC Algorithm
============================

.. sectionauthor:: Axel Huebl <a.huebl (at) hzdr.de>

This is an "empty" example, initializing a default particle-in-cell cycle with default algorithms [BirdsallLangdon]_ [HockneyEastwood]_ but without a specific test case.
When run, it iterates a particle-in-cell algorithm on a vacuum without particles or electro-magnetic fields initialized, which are the default ``.param`` files in ``include/picongpu/param/``.

This is a case to demonstrate and test these defaults are still (syntactically) working.
In order to set up your own simulation, there is no need to overwrite all ``.param`` files but only the ones that are different from the defaults.
As an example, just overwrite the default laser (none) and initialize a species with a density distribution.
