--- # Limits for run-time tests in the folder examples/
limits:
  description: |
               This file contains the limits for allowed run-time tests in the
               example's `documentation.yml`. Maintainers of the examples
               should not exceed this limits, else their tests will be
               considered as *failed*.
               A zero-value for a limit means *no limit*.

  tests:       5                   # the maximum number of tests per example
  gpus:        16                  # the maximum number of GPUs a test can use
  walltime:    01:00:00            # the TOTAL walltime that is allowed for ALL
                                   #   tests of A SINGLE example to finish,
                                   #   including pre- and post-processing
