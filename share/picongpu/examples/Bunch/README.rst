This is a simulation of an electron bunch that collides head-on with a laser pulse.
Depending on the number of electrons in the bunch, their momentum and their distribution and depending on the laser wavelength and intensity, the emitted radiation differs.
A general description of this simulation can be found in [PauschDipl]_.
A detailed analysis of this bunch simulation can be found in [Pausch13]_.
A theoretical study of the emitted radiation in head-on laser electron collisions can be found in [Esarey93]_.

This test simulates an electron bunch with a relativistic gamma factor of gamma=5.0 and with a laser with a_0=1.0.
The resulting radiation should scale with the number of real electrons (incoherent radiation).
