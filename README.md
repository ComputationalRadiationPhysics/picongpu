Introduction
------------

PIConGPU is a fully relativistic, many
[GPGPU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit),
3D3V particle-in-cell ([PIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle-in-cell))
code. The Particle-in-Cell algorithm is a central tool in plasma physics.
It describes the dynamics of a plasma by computing the motion of
electrons and ions in the plasma based on
[Maxwell's equations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_equations).

PIConGPU implements various numerical schemes to solve the PIC cycle.
Its features include:
- a Yee-lattice like grid structure
- particle pushers that solve the equation of motion for
charged particles, e.g. the *Boris-* and the *Vay-Pusher*
- Maxwell field solvers, e.g. *Yee's* and *Lehe's* scheme
- rigorously charge conserving current deposition schemes, proposed by
*Villasenor-Buneman* and *Esirkepov*
- macro-particle form factors ranging from NGP (0th order), CIC (1st), TSC(2nd)
  to PSQ (3rd)

Besides the central PIC algorithm, we developed a wide range of tools and diagnostics, e.g.:
- online, far-field radiation diagnostics for coherent and incoherent radiation
  emitted by charged particles
- full hdf5 restart and dumping capabilities
- 2D and 3D live view and diagnostics tools

Todays GPUs reach a performance up to
[TFLOP/s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS)
at considerable lower invest and maintenance cost compared to CPU-based compute
architectures of similar performance. The latest high-performance systems
([TOP500](http://www.top500.org/)) are enhanced by accelerator hardware that
boost their peak performance up to the multi-PFLOP/s level. With its
outstanding performance, PIConGPU is one of the **finalists** of the 2013s
[Gordon Bell Prize](http://sc13.supercomputing.org/content/acm-gordon-bell-prize).

PIConGPU is developed and maintained by the
[Junior Group Computational Radiation Physics](http://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=132&pOid=30354)
at the [Institute for Radiation Physics](http://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=132)
at [HZDR](http://www.hzdr.de/) in close collaboration with the Center
for Information Services and High Performance Computing
([ZIH](http://tu-dresden.de/die_tu_dresden/zentrale_einrichtungen/zih)) of the
Technical University Dresden ([TUD](http://www.tu-dresden.de)). We are a
member of the [Dresden CUDA Center of Excellence](http://ccoe-dresden.de/) that
cooperates on a broad range of scientific CUDA applications, workshops and
teaching efforts.
