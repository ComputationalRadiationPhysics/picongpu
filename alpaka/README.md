The **alpaka** library is a header-only C++14 abstraction library for accelerator development.

Its aim is to provide performance portability across accelerators through the abstraction (not hiding!) of the underlying levels of parallelism.

It is platform independent and supports the concurrent and cooperative use of multiple devices such as the hosts CPU as well as attached accelerators as for instance CUDA GPUs and Xeon Phis (currently native execution only).
A multitude of accelerator back-end variants using CUDA, OpenMP (2.0/4.0), Boost.Fiber, std::thread and also serial execution is provided and can be selected depending on the device.
Only one implementation of the user kernel is required by representing them as function objects with a special interface.
There is no need to write special CUDA, OpenMP or custom threading code.
Accelerator back-ends can be mixed within a device queue.
The decision which accelerator back-end executes which kernel can be made at runtime.

The abstraction used is very similar to the CUDA grid-blocks-threads division strategy.
Algorithms that should be parallelized have to be divided into a multi-dimensional grid consisting of small uniform work items.
These functions are called kernels and are executed in parallel threads.
The threads in the grid are organized in blocks.
All threads in a block are executed in parallel and can interact via fast shared memory.
Blocks are executed independently and can not interact in any way.
The block execution order is unspecified and depends on the accelerator in use.
By using this abstraction the execution can be optimally adapted to the available hardware.

Other compilers or combinations marked with :x: in the table above may work but are not tested in CI and are therefore not explicitly supported.

Dependencies
------------

[Boost](https://boost.org/) 1.65.1+ is the only mandatory external dependency.
The **alpaka** library itself just requires header-only libraries.
However some of the accelerator back-end implementations require different boost libraries to be built.

When an accelerator back-end using *Boost.Fiber* is enabled, `boost-fiber` and all of its dependencies are required to be built in C++14 mode `./b2 cxxflags="-std=c++14"`.
When *Boost.Fiber* is enabled and alpaka is built in C++17 mode with clang and libstc++, Boost >= 1.67.0 is required.

When an accelerator back-end using *CUDA* is enabled, version *9.0* of the *CUDA SDK* is the minimum requirement.
*NOTE*: When using nvcc as *CUDA* compiler, the *CUDA accelerator back-end* can not be enabled together with the *Boost.Fiber accelerator back-end* due to bugs in the nvcc compiler.
*NOTE*: When using clang as a native *CUDA* compiler, the *CUDA accelerator back-end* can not be enabled together with any *OpenMP accelerator back-end* because this combination is currently unsupported.
*NOTE*: Separable compilation is only supported when using nvcc, not with clang as native *CUDA* compiler. It is disabled by default and can be enabled via the CMake flag `ALPAKA_CUDA_NVCC_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION`.

When an accelerator back-end using *OpenMP* is enabled, the compiler and the platform have to support the corresponding minimum *OpenMP* version.

When an accelerator back-end using *TBB* is enabled, the compiler and the platform have to support the corresponding minimum *TBB* version.


Usage
-----

The library is header only so nothing has to be built.
CMake 3.15+ is required to provide the correct defines and include paths.
Just call `ALPAKA_ADD_EXECUTABLE` instead of `CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE` or `ADD_EXECUTABLE` and the difficulties of the CUDA nvcc compiler in handling `.cu` and `.cpp` files are automatically taken care of.
Source files do not need any special file ending.
Examples of how to utilize alpaka within CMake can be found in the `example` folder.

The whole alpaka library can be included with: `#include <alpaka/alpaka.hpp>`
Code that is not intended to be utilized by the user is hidden in the `detail` namespace.

Furthermore, for a CUDA-like experience when adopting alpaka we provide the library [*cupla*](https://github.com/alpaka-group/cupla).
It enables a simple and straightforward way of porting existing CUDA applications to alpaka and thus to a variety of accelerators.
