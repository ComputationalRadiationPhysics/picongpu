# This tool binds a process and main memory to a numa node.
# OMP_NUM_THREADS is set to the number of threads within the numa node at
# default. If not every hardware thread of a core shall be used, the environment
# variable NUMA_HW_THREADS_PER_PHYSICAL_CORE can be steered to change
# OMP_NUM_THREADS accordingly. `numactl` and `/proc/cpuinfo` are used to
# calculate the number of numa nodes, sockets, and number of cores and hardware
# threads per numa node or socket.
#
# NUMA_HW_THREADS_PER_PHYSICAL_CORE is the number of used hardware threads
# (read "hyperthreads" for Intel) per physical core. If hyperthreading shall not
# be used, use "export NUMA_HW_THREADS_PER_PHYSICAL_CORE=1" before using
# cpuNumaStarter.sh
#
# dependencies: numactl, openmpi, hwloc or /proc/cpuinfo, whereby hwloc is more
# accurate
