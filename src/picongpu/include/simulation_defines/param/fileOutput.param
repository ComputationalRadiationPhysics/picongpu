     *
     * Those operations derive scalar field quantities from particle species
     * at runtime. Each value is mapped per cell. Some operations are identical
     * up to a constant, so avoid writing those twice to save storage.
     *
     * you can choose any of these particle to grid projections:
     *   - CreateDensityOperation: particle position + shape on the grid
     *   - CreateChargeDensityOperation: density * charge
     *       note: for species that do not change their charge state, this is
     *             the same as the density times a constant for the charge
     *   - CreateEnergyOperation: sum of kinetic particle energy per cell with
     *                            respect to shape (deprecated)
     *   - CreateEnergyDensityOperation: average kinetic particle energy per
     *                                   cell times the particle density
     *       note: this is the same as the sum of kinetic particle energy
     *             divided by a constant for the cell volume
     *   - CreateMomentumComponentOperation: ratio between a selected momentum
     *                                       component and the absolute
     *                                       momentum with respect to shape
     *   - CreateLarmorPowerOperation: radiated larmor power
     *                                 (needs ENABLE_RADIATION)
     *
     * for debugging:
     *   - CreateMidCurrentDensityComponentOperation:
     *       density * charge * velocity_component
     *   - CreateCounterOperation: counts point like particles per cell
