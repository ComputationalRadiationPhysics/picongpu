    /** Effective Atomic Numbers
     *
     * Due to the shielding effect of inner electron shells in an atom / ion
     * which makes the core charge seem smaller to valence electrons
     * new, effective, atomic core charge numbers can be defined to make the
     * crude barrier suppression ionization (BSI) model less inaccurate.
     *
     * @see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_nuclear_charge
     * or refer directly to the calculations by Slater or Clementi and Raimondi
     *
     * IMPORTANT NOTE:
     * You have to insert the values in REVERSE order since the lowest shell
     * corresponds to the last ionization process!
