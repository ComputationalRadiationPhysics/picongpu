     * While deriving a particle (particleDes) from another (T_SrcParticle), one
     * can afterward directly normalize the weighting back to the intended density:
     * - divide weighting with the `T_SrcParticle`'s densityRatio
     *   (to get macro particle weighting according to reference BASE_DENSITY * profile
     *    at this specific point in space & time)
     * - multiply weighting with own densityRatio (to get this species'
     *    densityRatio * BASE_DENSITY * profile)
     *
     * This is useful when the profile and number of macro particles for both species
     * shall be the same and the initialization of another profile via `CreateDensity`
     * would be expensive (or one wants to keep the exact same position while deriving).
