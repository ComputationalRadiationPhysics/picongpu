     * - takes the ionization energies of the various charge states of ions
     * - calculates the ionization rates and then the ionization probabilities from them
     * - ATTENTION: this approach is not very applicable for rapidly changing high intensity laser fields
     * - this is a Monte Carlo method: if a random number is smaller
     *   or equal than the ionization probability -> increase the charge state
     * - see for example: Delone, N. B.; Krainov, V. P. (1998).
