     * - takes the ionization energies of the various charge states of ions
     * - calculates the corresponding field strengths necessary to overcome the binding energy of the electron to the core
     * - if the field strength is locally exceeded: increase the charge state
     * - see for example: Delone, N. B.; Krainov, V. P. (1998). "Tunneling and barrier-suppression ionization of atoms and ions in a laser radiation field"
