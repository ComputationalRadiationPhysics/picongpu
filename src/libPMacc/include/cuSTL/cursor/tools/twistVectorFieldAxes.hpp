/** Returns a new cursor which looks like a vector field rotated version of the one passed
 *
 * When rotating a vector field in physics the coordinate system and the vectors themselves
 * have to be rotated. This is the idea behind this function. It is assuming that the cursor
 * which is passed returns in its access call a vector type of the same dimension as in
 * the jumping call. In other words, the field and the vector have the same dimension.
 *
 * e.g.: new_cur = twistVectorFieldAxes<math::CT::Int<1,2,0> >(cur); // x -> y, y -> z, z -> x
 *
 * \tparam Axes compile-time vector (PMacc::math::CT::Int) that describes the mapping.
 * x-axis -> Axes::at<0>, y-axis -> Axes::at<1>, ...
