Implementation
==============

The implementation of the library in C++, especially the way C++11 allows to define the abstract concepts and to take advantage of the zero-overhead compile-time polymorphism is explained in this section.
Furthermore, it is described how the abstraction can be mapped to real devices.

2. [Mapping onto Specific Hardware Architectures](implementation/Mapping.md)
