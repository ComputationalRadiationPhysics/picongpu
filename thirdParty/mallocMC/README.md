mallocMC
=============

mallocMC: *Memory Allocator for Many Core Architectures*

This project provides a framework for **fast memory managers** on **many core
accelerators**. Currently, it supports **NVIDIA GPUs** of compute capability
`sm_20` or higher through the *ScatterAlloc* algorithm.


Usage
-------

Follow the step-by-step instructions in [Usage.md](Usage.md) to replace your
`new`/`malloc` calls with a *blacingly fast* mallocMC heap! :rocket:


Install
-------

mallocMC is header-only, but requires a few other C++ libraries to be
available. Our installation notes can be found in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

Rules for contributions are found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

On the ScatterAlloc Algorithm
-----------------------------

This library implements the *ScatterAlloc* algorithm, originally
[forked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29)
from the **ScatterAlloc** project, developed by the
[Managed Volume Processing](http://www.icg.tugraz.at/project/mvp)
group at [Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision](http://www.icg.tugraz.at),
TU Graz (kudos!).

From http://www.icg.tugraz.at/project/mvp/downloads :
```quote
ScatterAlloc is a dynamic memory allocator for the GPU. It is
designed concerning the requirements of massively parallel
execution.

ScatterAlloc greatly reduces collisions and congestion by
scattering memory requests based on hashing. It can deal with
thousands of GPU-threads concurrently allocating memory and its
execution time is almost independent of the thread count.

ScatterAlloc is open source and easy to use in your CUDA projects.
