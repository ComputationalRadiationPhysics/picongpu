         * This ReservePoolPolicy is intended for use with CUDA capable
         * accelerators that support at least compute capability 2.0. It should
         * be used in conjunction with a CreationPolicy that actually requires
         * the CUDA-internal heap to be sized by calls to cudaDeviceSetLimit().
         *
         * This policy sets the cudaLimitMallocHeapSize device limit. This value
         * can no longer be changed once a kernel using ::malloc()/::free() has
         * been run. Subsequent attempts will result in errors unless the device
         * is reset via cudaDeviceReset(). See:
         * https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/group__CUDART__DEVICE.html#group__CUDART__DEVICE_1g05956f16eaa47ef3a4efee84563ccb7d
