**cupla** - C++ User interface for the Platform independent Library Alpaka
==========================================================================

[![Build Status dev](https://img.shields.io/travis/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/cupla/dev.svg?label=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/cupla/branches)

**cupla** [[qχɑpˈlɑʔ]](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Qapla%27) is a simple user
interface for the platform independent parallel kernel
acceleration library
[**alpaka**](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/alpaka).
It follows a similar concept as the
[NVIDIA® CUDA® API](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) by
providing a software layer to manage accelerator devices.
**alpaka** is used as backend for **cupla**.

Please keep in mind that a first, ["find & replace"](doc/PortingGuide.md) port
from **CUDA to cupla(x86)** will result in rather bad performance. In order to
reach decent performance on x86 systems you just need to add the **alpaka**
[element level](doc/TuningGuide.md) to your kernels.

(*Read as:* add some *tiling* to your CUDA kernels by letting the same thread
compute a fixed number of elements (N=4..16) instead of just computing one
*element* per thread. Also, make the number of elements in your tiling a
*compile-time constant* and your CUDA code (N=1) will just stay with the
very same performance while adding single-source performance portability for,
e.g., x86 targets).
